# Jekyll-Matyus

Jekyll boilerplate.

## Philosophy

This is a Jekyll boilerplate. It is _not_ a Jekyll theme. It is intended for extremely minimalistic and accessible websites.

You are barking up the wrong tree if you intend on building a highly interactive web application. However there's nothing stopping you (and there's very little here to get in your way) if you intend on adding configuration for a web application.

## Getting Started

```
bundle install
```

## Development

```
bundle exec jekyll s
```

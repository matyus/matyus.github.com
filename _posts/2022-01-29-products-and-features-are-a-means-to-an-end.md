## An analogy

Let’s say our user’s problem is that they’re thirsty but they aren’t able to quench their own thirst.

The **means** for quenching their thirst might be to provide them with a drinking vessel.

The **end** is that they are quenched, or no longer thirsty.

In other words, the value that we need to provide is that we quench the user’s thirst.

So one way to frame this is that the design and build of the vessel is a matter of circumstance (a means) for quenching thirst. It’s not the only means, but it’s the ideal solution for our situation.

## Taking the analogy further…

Perhaps the “least amount of work” solution is to not create a vessel, but to teach them how to cup their hands into a bowl.

We can then observe how they handle the situation without us doing anything for them. This will give us a better understanding of what kind of vessel it is that they need – that’s great, because we can still learn how to solve the problem without having to do very much work at all.

The “work” we need to do, so far: create a tutorial for the user who can now self-remedy the problem with tools they already have (their two hands).

Maybe we find that cupping their hands into a bowl to quench their thirst creates more problems.

Maybe the user needs a bigger vessel, or a vessel with a lid for reasons we didn’t foresee, etc. (Now we’re getting somewhere!)

What’s amazing is that we can glean these insights, and we haven’t had to design and build a single version of what we assumed the vessel should be. Now we can have confidence that our proof of concept is going to validate the problem we originally identified: how best to quench the thirst of a user, and we can base our decisions on their actual observed needs.

## Frame of mind

Why is it important to do the least amount of work possible?
In a society we need to be smart (and deliberate) about how we use our most precious finite resource: time.

The better we use our time with the resources we have (people, tools, etc.), then that essentially means the better we are evolving as a business and providing something that our customers find valuable …and therefore will pay us for.

### Greater than the whole

This contrived example of thirsty users is a long winded way to say that our job isn’t “to build products and features for our customers”, our job is “to solve their problems”.

It’s a matter of a circumstance that we usually solve their problems in the form of products or features.

What’s not immediately obvious but important to acknowledge here is that solving these problems is truly a team effort.

Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important for us to be open with each other so that we can best leverage each other’s strengths and help level each other up as we collaborate.

That’s when the parts of a team become greater than the whole.

That’s when we achieve greatness.

### How do we frame our goals?

Let’s take a step back…

Maybe when we first started out we wanted to be the team that sells as many thirst-quenching vessels to as many thirsty customers for as cheaply as possible.

But through talking to users and experimenting with  various solutions we find that there’s a very specific and very valuable subset of customers that will pay through the nose to have their needs met.

It’s not necessarily about either strategy being good or bad, but maybe we find that one is more profitable for us.

### Alignment

Our team needs to understand where we want to be a month from now, a quarter from now, a year from now (vision) and why we’re doing what we’re doing (mission), so that we have a destination to chart towards, or an ideal to work backwards from.

Writing out these ideas helps inform us not only what to value but also how to prioritize what’s important in a way that’s not at the whim/opinion of any one person on the team.

The way in which we work together starts to become clear, and now we can start to understand what the process for working together should be.

### Measure, reflect, improve

It’s not impossible to improve something that you’re not measuring, but it can be hard to demonstrate (and feel confident about) because it’s not very rigorous.

There will be obvious improvements at times, but how do you know you didn’t get lucky?

Can you point to something and definitively say “this is why we’ve improved the way we work”? Or is it correlation?

### Metrics are not goals

Profits and losses are great indicators of successes or failures for a business unit but they are merely measurements that we use to better understand “how we’re doing”. It’s a proxy for the value we provide for our customers since the exchange of capital is quantitative.

The actual “value” we aim to bring to our customers could also be measured in terms of quenchedness, happiness, etc. just know that these metrics are harder to quantify and can be a bit more subjective than dollars and cents.

We will measure that qualitatively because they help enrich our understanding of a complex situation.

If your team is profit driven (their main goal is measured by profit) then it’s very possible you may make decisions in the interest of profit at the expense of the user’s actual needs.

Keeping in mind that profits are metrics and distinctly different from your goals is how Goodhart’s Law works:

Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a useful metric.

Humanity violates this Law constantly without realizing it, so the least you can do is talk to your team and make sure you all can distinguish between metrics and goals is a productive way.

### Working with agility

There isn’t one way to measure a team’s progress or productivity.

This section will sound loaded no matter how hard I try to abstract what I think is valuable about a team’s process, so we ask that you please bear with us.

I prefer to frame this idea as a team “working with agility” to a team “having an Agile process”.

You can hear [a lucid explanation of what this means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M) from one of the founding fathers [^thomas] of the _Agile Manifesto_ because he explains how the philosophy was repurposed over the years by people who more or less packaged it into something marketable that companies could buy. The act of that has somehow warped the original intentions, which are astoundingly simple:

>  We are uncovering better ways of developing<br />
>  software by doing it and helping others do it.<br />
>  Through this work we have come to value:
>
>  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br />
>  Working software over comprehensive documentation<br />
>  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br />
>  Responding to change over following a plan
>
>  That is, while there is value in the items on<br />
>  the right, we value the items on the left more.

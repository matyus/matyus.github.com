> It's about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same.  It's not enough to care only about people's ability to perform a job.  To have a good relationship, you have to be your whol self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being.  It's not just business; it is personal, and _deeply_ personal.[^trust]

Questions for managers:

> "What growth trajectory does each person on my team _want_ to be right now?"
> "Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?"
> "What growth trajectory do my direct reports believe they are on? Do I agree? And if I don't, why don't I?"[^questions]

Scott mentions that some people want to grow and have the potential but haven't been given the proper opportunities. However, some people are happy with the responsibilities that they have but just want more money or recognition.

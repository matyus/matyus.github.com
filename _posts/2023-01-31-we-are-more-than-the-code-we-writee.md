It feels good to write code, edit code, and delete code. 
These activities are often exercises in creative problem solving. 
They take energy to do and therefore _feel_ productive. 

And of course we all know not all the code we write _does_ contribute 
something valuable to the big picture. 

It's also not fair to tell someone--especially someone inexperienced--to write less code. 
Experience is gained from writing terrible code. 
An equal amount of experience is gained from writing "good" code (whatever that means). 

What's important is that we are learning from the things we do.

need to appreciate that within the context of what's important 
on various levels

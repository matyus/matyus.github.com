> Bosses at Google can't simply promote people on their teams at their own discretion.  In engineering, managers can encourage or discourage a person from pursuing another, and they can lobby for the person or not, but people nominate _themselves_ for a promotion, and a committee makes the decision.  Once a "promotion packet" consisting a list of accomplishments and recommendations has been assembled, a committee read it and decides if the promotion should go through.[^promotions]

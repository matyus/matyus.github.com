Interviewing is hard!!!! but it's also fun and rewarding when it's done well.

If it feels like things aren't going well, it may motivate your team to revisit their Interview Process. 

And the coding exercise always gets the most scrutiny, especially if the team isn't aligned on what the goals are.

This is more or less another observation on how the coding exercise is a means to an end, but I think a useful analogy here is staring us right in the face: it's word "exercise".

It seems like a coincidence that word we use for a coding interview is the same word we use for strength conditioning, but here we are.


## Why is it called a “coding exercise”?

Any kind of exercise, whether it be coding, weight-lifting, etc, are intended to assess the fitness of something in some situation.

Doing a compound movement, like a deadlift, is a lot like doing a coding exercise: 

When you’re working out, you're _interrogating_ a set of muscles with resistance and seeing how they all respond in concert. 

And when you're interviewing a candidate, you're _interrogating_ a set of their skills with problems and see how they use their experience in concert. 

Provide some kind of stimulus and observe the response. 


## Validating success using indirection

For many reasons you can't just ask someone "can you lift 500 kilos?" and take them at their word. 

Additionally, what you're trying to learn shouldn't necessarily be "can they lift 500 kilos?"

We can't reasonably be so binary in our assessment when it comes to interviewing candidates. If only it were so simple.

To blend our analogy a bit, the assessments should be more in the spirit of: 

- **What was the quality of the reps?** 
  How many projects did they do and how difficult were those projects?
  
- **How was their form?** 
  Did they write clean code that other engineers could reason about?
  
- **Did they use their full range of motion?** 
  What kind of experiences did they draw upon and apply in a new context?
  
- **Did they good mind-muscle connection?** 
  What level of self-awareness did they have?
  
- **Did they use you as a spotter?**
  Were they receptive or eliciting feedback and suggestions?
  
  
Now we have a rich collection of observations from which to draw upon after the interview.

We can begin to assess which level the candidate operates at but also what kind of potential they might have.

And even more importantly, we can being to distinguish between which parts of the candidate that are inherent and not likely to change, and which parts are coachable. 


## Cooling down

It's possible to gain experience in a lot of different ways and it’s our job to glean meaningful information from all the clues. 

It doesn’t necessarily mean: how many jobs did you have, and how many years did you work at each of those jobs. 

It does necessarily mean: what did you learn and how did you grow while you working that job?

What might all of this say about how they assimilate, grow, and raise-the-bar for our team?


## Post-huddle

Finally, we must cross reference our findings with the rest of the team.

Regrouping after the interview loop we will be asking ourselves, "did they pass the coding exercise?"

And we will answer with a set of qualitative observations instead of the binary "yes or no".

And we will use those oberservations to decide whether the rewards of hiring the candidate outweigh the possible risks.

Since hiring is an extremely expensive process (in terms of time, energy, money, everything), derisking each new hire is immensely important.


## Recovery

As a candidate, it's takes a lot to put yourself out there in an interview. 

You might feel good about how everything went but still not get the job. 

Conversely, I wouldn't want a candidate accepting a job offer that they didn't feel good about.  

You can't force these things. 

Fitness is not singular.  A power lifter and a marathon runner aren’t exactly interachangeable.

There will be times where our team interviews an amazing marathoner but we know we need a strong power lifter, and we have to pass on the marathoner.

You can't let your sense of self-worth be dictated by the number of offers you get—especially in a tough job market—where your livelihood could literally be on the line. 

It's not something to be take personally, unfortunately this is business.

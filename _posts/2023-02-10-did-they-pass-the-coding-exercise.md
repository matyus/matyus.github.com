well, did they pass the coding exercise?

interviewing is hard and stressful for everyone involved.

and because of that there is often an impulse to refactor the process (the what) in favor of better evaluating a candidate in a repeatable and scientific way (the how). 

but I think a small adjustment in perspective can have a big effect on our expectations and approach, and therefore diffuse some of the anxiety. all without changing any of the material. 

we should start by asking ourselves:
“what are the goals of the coding exercise during an interview loop?”

tangent—-

why is it called “coding exercise”?

it’s not a coincidence that this is the same word we use for lifting a barbell off the ground. 

time for an analogy!

doing a compound movement, like a deadlift, is a lot like doing a coding exercise: 

you’re interrogating a set of muscles with resistance and seeing how they all respond in concert. 

also have a nice little metric that you can track over time: 

how much weight are you lifting?

BUT WAIT 

lifting heavy weights doesn’t happen from doing that once. 

Strength is gained by having done many reps over time, consistently, usually in sets, with a progressively increasing load. 

If I ask you to lift a 25 kilo barbell once I don’t have too much information. Likewise, in an interview I need to ask you more than one question, too. 

Bodybuilders are very much having a conversation with their bodies, they’re “interrogate the muscles” with weight and observing the response. 

Interviewers are interrogating candidates to see what kind of response they get. 

Questions in an interview should be structured in a way that requires the candidate to demonstrate their experience. 

Quantity is also not necessarily what I’m interested in here. 

You could tell me that you lift 500 kilos once. 
You could tell me that you life 100 kilos 100 times. 


What about the quality of those reps?
Are you using your full range of motion? 
Do you have good mind-muscle connection?

You can gain experience in a lot of different ways and it’s my job to glean meaningful information from certain metrics. 

It doesn’t necessarily mean: how many jobs did you have, and how many years did you work at each of those jobs. 

It does necessarily mean: what did you learn and how did you grow while you working that job?

Final point:

Fitness is not singular. A power lifter and a marathon runner aren’t equal. 

We need to know what we’re looking for in order to know how and what we should hire for because nothing is more unfortunate than interviewing a really amazing powerlifter when all your team needs is a marathoner.

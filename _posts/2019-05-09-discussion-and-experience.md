> â€¦from John Stuart Mill:
>
> "The source of everything respectable in man either has an intellectual or as a moral being [is] that his errors are corrigible.  He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience.  Not by experience alone.  There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted."[^experience]

[^experience]: Scott, 2017, p. 14

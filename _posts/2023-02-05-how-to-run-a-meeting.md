Don't be the person who schedules a meeting that should've been an email.

Preparing a meeting notes document can help keep you honest, and at the very least ensures that the meeting itself is productive. 


Here is what goes through my head when I feel like I need to have a meeting...

## What problem, goal, or outcome do I need to schedule the meeting for?

Articulating on paper what seems obvious in my head can be shockingly difficult!

Writing it down helps me:

- Articulate what the point of the meeting is _for other people_
- Realize I don't need to have a meeeting at all
- Consider that I can send email or instant message instead
- etc...


## What discrete topics do I expect to cover during the meeting?

Agenda items, time boxed.

Listing the topics to cover helps me:

- Quantify how many unique topics to cover
- How long the meeting should be (hopefully 30 minutes or less!)
- Who needs to be present for the meeting vs. informed of the outcomes


## Who do I think needs to be involved?

List each person. Inviduals can be specified as required or optional.

This helps me:

- Get the right people together
- Keep the size of the meeting manageable


## Share the meeting note document ahead of time

Given the proposed agenda, this allows the invitees to:

- Give constructive feedback on the goals, agenda, attendees
- Mentally prepare, ask questions ahead of time, etc.
- Opt-out (they can stay informed via the meeting notes afterwards)


## During the meeting

Some things to consider while I'm having the meeting.

I hate to say this but Ice breakers, while cheesy, are also helpful because they actually "break the ice" and force a bit of socializing which is especially important in a remote or hybrid meeting. (The hard part can be keeping them lean!)

There are three active roles a well-formed meeting should have, and each role should be designated to a separate person.

**Roles and responsibilites:**

- **Facilitator:** Leads the meeting, guides/interrupts the conversations while also making sure everyone participates ([DEIB](https://www.findem.ai/knowledge-center/what-is-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-belonging)), etc.
- **Note taker:** Level of detail should be useful for absentees. Avoid being verbose. Elicit help from the group aggregating links/pictures/docs/etc. shared during the meeting.
- **Time keeper:** Holds the group accountable to the time boxed agenda items. Can interrupt the conversations.

As the facilitator I think it helps to point out that me or the timekeeper may interrupt conversations (rabbit holes) for the sake of the greater meeting.

## Action items

If I just had a meeting, we probably wrote down things we want to do.

Each item needs three things:

- **Assignee/owner:** An unassigned task is doomed. 
- **Concrete actionable task:** An unclear task will never get "done", ask the group "what is the definition of done?".
- **Due date:** And a missing due will leave the task hanging forever.

Scrutinize the action items and make sure they're important and help achieve the meeting's goals. 


## Meeting Notes Template

Anatomy of a Meeting Notes document:

1. Title/summary
2. Date/time
3. Attendees
4. Goals/outcomes
5. Agenda (time boxed topics)
6. Action items

The [Confluence Meeting Notes template](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/meeting-notes) is not a terrible place to start.

> It's brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up. You don't _want_ to hurt anyone's feelings; that's because you're not a sadist.  You don't want that person or the rest of the team to think you're a jerk.  Plus, you've been told since you learned to talk, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."  Now all of the sudden it's your _job_ to say it.  You've got to undo a lifetime of training.  Management is hard.

> To make matters worse, I kept making the same mistake over and over for ten months.  As you probably know, for every piece of subpar work you accept, for every missed deadline you let slip, you begin to feel resentment and then anger.  You no longer just think the work is bad: you think the person is bad.  This makes it harder to have an even-keeled conversation.  You start to avoid talking to the person at all.[^introduction]

> In World War II, the U.S. Air Force took their very best pilots from the front lines and sent them home to train new pilots.  Over time this strategy dramatically improved the quality and effectiveness of the U.S. Air Force.  The Germans lost their air superiority because they flew all their aces until they were shot down; none of them trained new recruits.  By 1944 new German pilots had clocked only about half of the three hundred hours an Allied pilot would have flown in training.[^training]

This feels very much like using the best members on your team to "teach the team how to fish."

Because we are all extremely smart and creative thinkers, let's agree that "design" is not a thing-in-itself; let's agree that design is abstract, that it is a means to an end; design is a process; design is a solution to a problem.

Therefore, we should be able to apply the principles set forth by Dieter Rams—with minimal effort—to any sort of role, so let's take a look at how this might be applied to that of software engineering:

> <span>1.</span> **Good design is innovative** — The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

If we are to replace the word "design" with "software" then first principle reads seamlessly:

_Good [software] is innovative._

Good software doesn't solve a problem that has already been solved and it doesn't solve problems that don't exist or don't need solving.

> <span>2.</span> **Good design makes product useful** — A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.

I think we can contort this one a bit, because the "useful" aspect of good engineering could be be seen from the perspective of the code itself, or in other words, how usable other engineers find any given abstractions: "Good [software] emphasizes the usefulness of [the code] while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it."

_Good [software] makes [engineering] useful._

> <span>3.</span> **Good design is aesthetic** — The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

Again, this requires a bit of contorting because the objects at hand may be interpreted to be code abstractions (i.e. An API, or interface, or Class, etc.)

_Good [software] is aesthetic._

> <span>4.</span> **Good design makes a product understandable** — It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self explanatory.
Bad code is not self-explanatory and therefore not intuitive or easily understood:

_Good [software] makes [engineering] understandable._

> <span>5.</span> **Good design is unobtrusive** — Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.

This reads seamlessly. Especially the last sentence, "[software] should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the [engineer's] self-expression."

Clean code abstractions don't get in the way of the people who are utilizing them and are flexible enough for a variety of uses.

_Good [software] is unobtrusive._

> <span>6.</span> **Good design is honest** — It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.

Good software, if it is unobtrusive and easily understandable is therefore honest. Good software won't make claims that it can handle more than it should becuase good software is aware of its own limitations and can communicate that accordingly.

_Good [software] is honest._

> <span>7.</span> **Good design is long-lasting** — It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it last many years – even in today's throwaway society.

Another one that reads seamlessly.

_Good [software] is long-lasting._

> <span>8.</span> **Good design is thorough down to the last detail** — Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect to the user.

_Good [software] is thorough down to the last detail._

> <span>9.</span> **Good design is environmentally friendly** — Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the life cycle of the product.

This is a hard one to translate into software engineering, unless you interpret the "environment" that the code runs in.

Bad software will be bloated, or it will have too many dependencies, or demand too many resources from the server, or be hard to maintain. Good software is considerate and will treat both engineers and servers with respect and empathy.

_Good [software] is environmentally friendly._

> <span>10.</span> **Good design is as little design as possible** — Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.
>
> Back to purity, back to simplicity. [^vitso]

Duh, _Good [software] is as little [software] as possible._

Just to recap:

1. Good [software] is innovative.
1. Good [software] makes [engineering] useful.
1. Good [software] is aesthetic.
1. Good [software] makes [engineering] understandable.
1. Good [software] is unobtrusive.
1. Good [software] is honest.
1. Good [software] is long-lasting.
1. Good [software] is thorough down to the last detail.
1. Good [software] is environmentally friendly.
1. Good [software] is as little [software] as possible.

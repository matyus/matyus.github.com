Avoid the impulse to drive right into the "Get Stuff Done" wheel:

> 1. Listen — to everyone's ideas
> 2. Clarify — those ideas and sharpen them
> 3. Debate — and test the ideas rigorously
> 4. Decide — quickly, but not too quickly
> 5. Persuade — those who weren't involved
> 6. Execute — it/build it/do it
> 7. Learn — determine whether you did the right thing, then repeat the process again[^gsd]

> If you skip a step, you'll waste time in the end. If you allow any part of the process to drag out, working on your team will feel like paying a collaboration tax, not making a collaboration investment.[^warning]

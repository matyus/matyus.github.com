> Challenging other and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren't going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you're wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made.  But because challenging often involves disagreeing or saying no, this approach embraces conflict rather than avoiding it.[^challenging]

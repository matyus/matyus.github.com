Evaluating when to fire:

> - Have you given Radically Candid guidance?"
> - How is this person's poor performance affecting the rest of the team?"
> - Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you trust and with whom you can talk the problem through?"[^evaluation]

Common excuses you may make to not fire:

> - It will get better
> - Somebody is better than nobody
> - Transfer is the answer
> - It's bad for morale[^excuses]

Doing the firing:

> - Recall a job you were terrible at and think how glad you feel that you're no longer in it
> - Retaining people who are doing bad work penalizes the people doing the excellent work (retaining a bad boss is especially damaging!)[^action]

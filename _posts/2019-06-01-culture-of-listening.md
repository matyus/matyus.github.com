Creating a culture of listening:

> 1. have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas/voice complaints
> 2. make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed
> 3. regularly offer explanation as to why other issues aren't being addressed[^listening]

This should both empower people to point things but also enable people to help fix/make changes.
